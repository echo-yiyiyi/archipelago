# --- Stateful (session-affine) gateway proxy ----------------------------------
# A serving server can opt into session affinity (default off). When set, the
# gateway connects ONE StatefulProxyClient for THAT server and reuses its session
# for every tool call, so the browser's page/refs/cookies survive across calls
# instead of resetting to about:blank. The connect must run in a long-lived owner
# task, never an inbound request task, or its streamable-HTTP cancel scope is
# orphaned when the request ends and crashes the next reuse. Affinity is scoped
# per server, never world-wide: a session connected outside a request never
# carries the per-call `Authorization: Bearer <actor_id>` rewrite, so sweeping a
# tenancy-enforcing backend (e.g. the email app) into the affine path breaks it
# with "Missing Authorization: Bearer <user_id> header." on every call.
#
# WARNING — this session-affine path depends on UNDOCUMENTED fastmcp internals. Do
# not upgrade fastmcp without re-validating ALL of the following against the new
# version:
#   1. StatefulProxyClient.__aexit__ is a no-op, so fastmcp's per-call nesting_counter
#      accumulates and never decrements (the reconnect logic below exists solely to
#      recover from the error this causes when a backend session later drops).
#   2. Client._connect raises a RuntimeError containing `_NESTING_COUNTER_ERROR` when a
#      session is (re)started with the counter != 0 — the exact reconnect trigger.
#   3. create_proxy() reuses a *connected* client's session for every call because
#      `type(client) is ProxyClient` is False for this subclass. This is what actually
#      defeats about:blank, and a regression here is SILENT (no error, just a broken
#      browser), so it is the most dangerous of the three to miss.
# fastmcp moves these between minor releases (3.4.2 already split the distribution into
# fastmcp + fastmcp-slim). The env pins 3.2.0 but the specifier is unbounded
# (`fastmcp>=3.2.0`) and the same monorepo already runs 3.4.2 in hosted-envs/uv.lock.
# On any bump, re-run the session-reuse + drop-recovery tests in test_mcp_gateway.py:
# they fail-closed on (1) and (2), but NOT reliably on (3) — verify (3) by hand.
