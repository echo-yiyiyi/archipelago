"""Cold-start seed + warm-task refresh for the SQLite runtime DB.

Three functions, one per process role. Calling the wrong one in the
wrong place can clobber an active server's runtime DB; the API split is
the safety contract.

============================  ============================================
Function                       Who calls it
============================  ============================================
:func:`cold_seed_runtime`     The server itself, exactly once at import
                              time, before the engine is opened. Idempotent
                              (no-op when the runtime DB already exists).
:func:`refresh_runtime_from_canonical`
                              Out-of-process workers (populate, sync,
                              backup) before they touch the runtime DB.
                              Drives a server-side checkpoint over HTTP
                              and refuses to copy if the WAL never clears.
:func:`resolve_runtime_path`  Anyone — pure path lookup. Raises
                              :class:`RuntimeDbMissingError` if the
                              runtime DB hasn't been seeded yet (escape
                              hatch ``_force=True``).
============================  ============================================

The "out-of-process" contract is load-bearing. A second process that
copies over a runtime DB the live server still has open will:

1. Overwrite un-checkpointed WAL frames the agent committed but the
   server hasn't folded back yet.
2. Poison the server's connection pool — every pooled fd holds a memory
   map into the now-stale ``-shm`` sidecar; the next operation raises
   ``SQLITE_IOERR`` and sticks until the server restarts.

That's why ``refresh_runtime_from_canonical`` drives a checkpoint via
HTTP first (so the server itself flushes its pool) and refuses to copy
if the WAL never reaches ``busy=0``.
