"""HTTP-layer DB gate — block traffic while the runtime DB is unstable.

This module provides a process-global "is the runtime DB safe to touch?"
flag plus the Starlette middleware that enforces it. The semantic is
deliberately broad: when the gate is closed, **the DB is unavailable
right now and handlers should not touch it**. The canonical use case is
populate / snapshot lifecycle work that mutates the runtime DB file
inode out from under live SQLAlchemy connections, but the same machinery
covers anything that needs the runtime DB file stable for a window —
restore-from-backup, schema migrations, cold-storage promotions.

How the pieces fit together
---------------------------

* :func:`is_db_disabled` / :func:`set_db_disabled` — the primitives.
  Process-global boolean guarded by a :class:`threading.Lock`. Flips are
  atomic; reads are lock-free (the cost of a stale read on the request
  path is one extra request served against a DB that just became
  available, or a 503 that should have passed — both acceptable).
* :class:`DbGateMiddleware` — Starlette ``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` that
  consults the flag on every request and short-circuits gated requests
  with 503 + ``Retry-After``. Whitelisted paths pass through with
  ``request.state.db_disabled = True`` so handlers (typically health
  probes) can adapt — e.g. skip a DB ping and return liveness only.
* :data:`DEFAULT_WHITELIST` — the paths that MUST stay reachable while
  the gate is closed: ``/health`` for orchestrators, ``/_internal/*`` for
  the lifecycle scripts that own the gate.

Sticky-closed-on-failure is intentional
---------------------------------------

When a lifecycle script crashes mid-run (populate dies after the
canonical is half-overwritten, snapshot exits before swapping the new
runtime in, etc.) the runtime DB is in an indeterminate state. There is
no watchdog that auto-clears the flag after a timeout, and no fallback
"if no enable_db within N seconds, assume the script crashed and reopen
traffic". That behaviour would be **wrong** — serving requests against
an indeterminate DB masks the real problem and produces hard-to-debug
data corruption downstream. A stuck-503 stream is a feature: operators
see it, page the on-call, and investigate. The lifecycle script's
``finally`` block (or a ``trap`` in bash) is the *only* mechanism that
should clear the flag, and only on a clean exit from the script's
recovery path.

Operator wiring guidance
------------------------

Register :class:`DbGateMiddleware` **first** (outermost) in the app's
middleware stack so requests are gated *before* any other middleware
gets a chance to touch the DB. Starlette runs middleware
last-added-runs-first, so the call order is::

    # Other middleware first (they end up "inside" the gate)...
    app.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware)
    app.add_middleware(AuthMiddleware)

    # ...and the gate last, so it runs outermost.
    app.add_middleware(DbGateMiddleware)

For FastMCP-shaped apps, follow the equivalent "register the gate so it
wraps everything else" ordering in whatever middleware-stacking API the
app exposes.

Health check handler pattern
----------------------------

A health probe that hits the DB will 503 itself when the gate closes,
which defeats the purpose of /health. Branch on ``request.state``::

    @mcp.custom_route("/health", methods=["GET"])
    async def health(request: Request) -> JSONResponse:
        if getattr(request.state, "db_disabled", False):
            # Skip DB probe; return liveness only.
            return JSONResponse({"status": "ok", "db_disabled": True})
        # Normal path: probe the DB.
        ...

Lifecycle script pattern
------------------------

Always wrap the work in a try/finally so a clean exit clears the gate.
A failure leaving the gate closed is correct — see the sticky-closed
discussion above. Bash::

    curl -fsS -X POST "http://localhost:$PORT/_internal/disable_db" || exit 1
    trap 'curl -fsS -X POST "http://localhost:$PORT/_internal/enable_db" || true' EXIT
    python -m populate

Python::

    requests.post(f"{base}/_internal/disable_db").raise_for_status()
    try:
        run_populate()
    finally:
        try:
            requests.post(f"{base}/_internal/enable_db", timeout=5)
        except Exception:
            pass  # sticky-closed-on-failure is correct

      can branch on the attribute to skip DB work (the canonical case is
