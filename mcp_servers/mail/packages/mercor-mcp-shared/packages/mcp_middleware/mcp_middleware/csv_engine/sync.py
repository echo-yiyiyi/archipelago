"""Synchronous facade over the async csv_engine import/export functions.

Several consuming apps (e.g. Foundry-Zoho) are synchronous — they use a
SQLAlchemy ``Session`` / ``Engine`` and never run an event loop. These wrappers
let them call the engine without writing ``async``/``await``:

    from mcp_middleware.csv_engine import import_from_zip_sync
    import_from_zip_sync(zip_bytes, "sqlite:///data.db", config)

Each wrapper accepts a **database URL string**, a sync ``Engine``, or an
``AsyncEngine``. For a URL or sync Engine it builds an ``AsyncEngine`` (mapping
the driver to its async variant — ``sqlite`` -> ``aiosqlite``, ``postgresql``
-> ``asyncpg``, ``mysql`` -> ``aiomysql``), runs the operation, and disposes it,
all on a single private event loop so connections stay loop-bound. An
``AsyncEngine`` passed in is used as-is and left open (the caller owns it).

    """Produce a clean SQLite snapshot of ``db`` at ``dst``.

    This is the **DB-only** complement of :func:`export_snapshot_sync` —
    no CSVs, no entity iteration. Use when the consumer wants a raw
    ``.db`` file (e.g. the Studio grader extracts the snapshot archive
    and opens ``workspace.db`` directly), separate from any CSV export
    flow that may also run on the same engine.

    How it works:

    1. **Checkpoint the engine's WAL** so the source DB on disk reflects
       every committed frame, then close idle connections. This is the
       same primitive :func:`mcp_middleware.runtime_db.run_wal_checkpoint`
       runs; we do it inline here because the consumer that asked for
       the snapshot is usually the same process that owns the engine.
    2. **Copy via the SQLite online-backup API** (``conn.backup()``).
       ``shutil.copy2`` of the main ``.db`` file alone silently omits
       frames still in ``-wal``; the online backup API reads a
       consistent snapshot that includes every committed WAL frame
       regardless of checkpoint state.
    3. **Switch the destination out of WAL mode**
       (``PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE``). Backup propagates the source's
       journal mode, so a WAL-mode source produces a WAL-mode
       destination — which would leave ``-wal`` / ``-shm`` sidecars next
       to the snapshot, defeating the "snapshot is just ``workspace.db``"
       contract.
    4. **Drop computed tables** on the *destination* copy. By default
       every virtual table in ``sqlite_master`` is dropped (FTS5 / vec0)
       so the snapshot ships only the agent-relevant ORM tables. Apps
       with additional regular computed tables (``docvec_documents``,
       ``docvec_chunks``, etc.) pass them via ``drop_tables=[...]``.
       Drop failures raise — silently skipping (the old behaviour) lets
       indexes survive into the snapshot without anyone noticing.
    5. **VACUUM** the destination so the pages freed by step 4 are
       actually reclaimed from the file. SQLite's ``DROP TABLE`` (and
       virtual-table ``xDestroy``) marks pages free in the page-map but
       leaves the file the same size on disk — without VACUUM, a 12 GB
       source with a 6 GB FTS5 index still ships as a 12 GB snapshot
       even though the index tables are gone from ``sqlite_master``.
       Skipped when no drops were requested (no freelist to reclaim).
    6. **Defensive sidecar cleanup**: after every connection closes, any
       lingering ``-wal`` / ``-shm`` / ``-journal`` files next to ``dst``
       are unlinked. By step 3 + step 5 there shouldn't be any, but
       defence in depth keeps the snapshot contract airtight.

    Args:
        dst: Destination path. Parent directory is created if missing.
        db: Database source — URL, sync ``Engine``, or ``AsyncEngine``.
            Only sync ``Engine`` benefits from the pool drain + checkpoint
            optimisation; the URL / AsyncEngine paths skip that step
            (no live pool to drain).
        drop_tables: Optional list of regular table names to drop on
            the destination copy. Each runs via ``DROP TABLE IF EXISTS``
            so missing tables are silently skipped. Drop failures on
            existing tables raise.
        drop_virtual_tables: **Default ``True``.** Drops every virtual
            table in the destination's ``sqlite_master`` via
            ``DROP TABLE`` (invokes ``xDestroy`` to clean up shadow
            B-trees). Triggers whose SQL body references a dropped
            virtual table are dropped too — they live as independent
            ``sqlite_master`` objects and are NOT cleaned up by
            ``xDestroy``. Pass ``False`` only when you genuinely want
            to ship FTS5 / vec0 indexes in the snapshot (rare;
            re-indexing on import is normally cheap and avoids the
            sqlite-vec / sqlite-fts5 dependency on the consumer).

    Returns:
        The absolute :class:`Path` to the produced ``.db`` file.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``db`` doesn't resolve to a SQLite file path.
        RuntimeError: If any virtual-table drop fails on the
            destination — typically when a ``vec0`` table is present
            but ``sqlite-vec`` can't be loaded (extension loading
            disabled in this SQLite build, or the package isn't
            installed). Silently shipping the index is worse than
            failing the snapshot.

    The standard ``snapshot_db_only`` path uses SQLite's online backup
    API to copy src→dst. That API can't back up a database to itself —
    it would either deadlock or corrupt the file. When the caller is
    operating with ``runtime == canonical`` (typically because they're
    in dev mode via ``MCP_RUNTIME_DB_COPY=0`` and the live engine reads
    canonical directly), the snapshot still has a useful job: fold any
    WAL frames into the main file, drop computed/virtual tables the
    caller doesn't want shipped, and VACUUM to reclaim pages.

    Behaviour differences vs the standard path:

    * **No journal_mode switch.** The standard path forces dst into
      DELETE mode so the snapshot ships without ``-wal`` / ``-shm``
      sidecars. Here, the live engine wants to stay in WAL — flipping
      it would force the live server into rollback-journal mode mid-run.
      WAL stays.
    * **No dst unlink on drop failure.** The standard path's safety net
      (``_remove_snapshot_artifacts``) deletes dst if any drop fails —
      that's right when dst is a separate snapshot file, catastrophic
      when dst is the live canonical. Drop failures here re-raise
      unchanged; cleanup is the caller's problem.
    * **No sidecar removal at end.** Same reasoning — the live engine
      owns -wal/-shm.

    ``VACUUM`` rewrites the database into a temporary copy that omits
    freelist pages, then atomically replaces the original. This is
    what actually shrinks the file on disk.

      ~500 MB after drops, peak is ~12.5 GB; the file ends at ~500 MB.

    """One-shot snapshot hook for the snapshot-only deploy lifecycle.

    For hosts where the populate hook can't run (Modal / Studio after
    populate was removed), the snapshot phase is the only entry point.
    This facade composes the two existing primitives in the order the
    lifecycle requires:

    1. :func:`mcp_middleware.runtime_db.cold_seed_runtime` — copy
       ``canonical_path`` to its hashed runtime path under ``/tmp``
       (typically tmpfs) **if and only if** the runtime is absent. The
       runtime copy keeps every FTS5 / vec0 index — the live engine
       reads from it across the agent task and across subsequent
       snapshot invocations. Idempotent: subsequent calls find the
       runtime already present and skip the copy.

    2. :func:`snapshot_db_only` — write a *clean* copy from the runtime
       back to ``canonical_path``, with FTS5 / vec0 (and any
       ``drop_tables``) stripped. The runtime is **untouched** — it
       keeps its indexes for the next task.

    Net effect at every snapshot phase:

    * ``canonical_path`` = clean DB ready for the host's filesystem
      capture (``format=files``) to grab without ~16 GB of FTS5 / vec0
      baggage.
    * Runtime DB at ``runtime_paths_for(canonical_path).runtime`` keeps
      the indexes for the live engine to use during the next task.

    **First-call semantics**: the caller may pass a freshly-deployed
    ``canonical_path`` that contains the indexed bytes from the previous
    deploy. ``cold_seed_runtime`` copies those bytes into the runtime
    location (preserving indexes), and ``snapshot_db_only`` then writes
    a clean copy back to the canonical (overwriting the indexed bytes).
    After this call: canonical = clean, runtime = indexed. The agent
    task runs against the runtime; the *next* snapshot call finds the
    runtime already populated and just refreshes the canonical from it.

    Args:
        canonical_path: The path the host's filesystem capture will
            grab — typically ``$STATE_LOCATION/workspace.db``. The
            runtime path is derived from this via
            :func:`runtime_paths_for(canonical_path).runtime`, so the
            same canonical always maps to the same runtime location.
        runtime: Optional override for the runtime path. When ``None``
            (default), cold_seed_runtime computes the hashed ``/tmp``
            path. Pass an explicit path when the live engine is bound
            somewhere other than the hashed default — typically
            ``binding.runtime`` from
            :func:`~mcp_middleware.runtime_db.bind_engine`. In particular,
            **direct-mode** bindings pass ``runtime=canonical_path``,
            which routes through :func:`snapshot_db_only`'s aliased
            branch: WAL checkpoint + drops + in-place VACUUM, no copy.
        drop_tables: Forwarded to :func:`snapshot_db_only` —
            additional named regular tables to drop on the snapshot
            copy (e.g. ``["docvec_documents", "docvec_chunks"]``).
        drop_virtual_tables: Forwarded to :func:`snapshot_db_only` —
            default ``True`` drops every CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE in
            ``sqlite_master``.

    Returns:
        The absolute :class:`Path` to the canonical snapshot file
        (same as the resolved ``canonical_path``).

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the runtime path doesn't exist after
            :func:`cold_seed_runtime` — either the canonical was absent
            (nothing to snapshot) or the cold-seed copy failed. Raised
            *before* the backup step so the canonical is never wiped to
            an empty database.
        ValueError: From :func:`snapshot_db_only` for non-file SQLite
            sources (``:memory:``, URI sources without a path).
        RuntimeError: From :func:`snapshot_db_only` if any computed-table
            drop fails on the snapshot copy.

    Example:
        Snapshot hook in a snapshot-only deploy (Modal / Studio)::

            from mcp_middleware.csv_engine import snapshot_db_via_runtime

            def on_snapshot():
                snapshot_db_via_runtime("/state/workspace.db")

        On first call the indexed canonical is preserved at the
        runtime path (``/tmp/workspace_runtime_<hash>.db``) and a
        clean copy is written to ``/state/workspace.db``. Every
        subsequent call refreshes the canonical from the runtime.

    """One-shot snapshot orchestration for the snapshot-only deploy lifecycle.

    Composes the five primitives every Foundry-* MCP server needs into
    a single call, so each app's ``snapshot.py`` becomes a one-liner
    passing its app-specific ``populate_engine.main`` and FTS rebuilder
    as callbacks.

    The orchestration shape is validated against Foundry-Google-Workspace
    PR #185 (``scripts/snapshot_engine.py``). The five steps are all
    idempotent, so the same hook fires correctly whether the Modal
    ``populate`` lifecycle hook ran beforehand or not, and whether the
    SME shipped pre-built ``.db`` files or CSV/JSON sources:

    1. :func:`mcp_middleware.runtime_db.harvest_db_files` — move every
       ``.db`` (and its WAL/SHM/srcmeta sidecars) out of ``state_dir``
       to its hashed ``/tmp`` runtime path. Pre-indexed input: the
       SME-uploaded DB lands at the runtime path. Cold-CSV / warm-reboot
       input: no ``.db`` to move; no-op.

    2. ``import_hook()`` — app-specific. Typically
       ``lambda: populate_engine.main([state_dir])`` for apps that
       ingest CSV/JSON sources. Must return an ``int`` exit code; a
       non-zero rc raises :class:`RuntimeError` and steps 3-5 don't run
       (the DB is in an unknown state). Omit for apps whose state is
       purely DB-uploaded.

       **Auto-skipped when step 1 harvested a DB matching
       ``canonical.name``.** The SME-shipped DB is the source of truth;
       re-ingesting raw sources on top of it would only produce PK
       collisions. The facade detects this case by inspecting the
       :func:`harvest_db_files` return value. If raw source files are
       *also* present in ``state_dir`` (matched by
       :func:`discover_snapshot` against ``config``), a warning is
       logged — the sources are deleted unread by step 4. The current
       contract is exclusive: pre-built DB OR raw sources, not both.
       (Future delta-application would be a separate explicit API.)

    3. ``build_index_hook()`` — app-specific. Builds the app's FTS5 /
       vec0 / per-app derived indexes on the runtime DB. Typically a
       closure over an app's ``init_fts`` + ``rebuild_fts`` + an
       ``index_needs_build`` guard. Omit for apps without an indexed
       schema.

    4. :func:`prune_imported_files` — delete every file in ``state_dir``
       that the importer just consumed (CSVs / JSONs / binaries
       declared as entities). Agent-created files in ``state_dir`` —
       which land AFTER this prune step — are preserved. Skipped
       entirely when ``config`` is ``None``.

    5. :func:`snapshot_db_via_runtime` — cold-seed the canonical to
       its runtime (no-op when the runtime is already present from
       step 1) then write a clean copy back to ``canonical`` with
       virtual tables + ``drop_tables`` stripped. The runtime is
       untouched — it keeps its indexes for the live engine to read
       during the next agent task.

    Net effect on every invocation: ``canonical`` is a clean indexless
    DB ready for the host's filesystem capture (Modal ``format=files``),
    and the runtime DB at
    :func:`runtime_paths_for(canonical).runtime` keeps its indexes for
    the live engine.

    .. warning::
       **Do not write to the runtime between** :func:`bind_engine` **and
       this call.** This facade rebuilds ``canonical`` from scratch via
       ``import_hook`` and step 1's harvest moves ``state_dir/<canonical>``
       onto the runtime path via :func:`shutil.move`. If something wrote
       to the runtime after a prior :func:`bind_engine` cold-seed (but
       before this call), the harvest will overwrite those writes — the
       ``.srcmeta`` marker only fingerprints the canonical at seed time
       and does not track subsequent runtime mutations. This is by design:
       the facade is a build pipeline, not an incremental writer. Either
       (a) keep population effects inside ``import_hook`` so step 1
       sequencing is honoured, or (b) use :func:`refresh_runtime_from_canonical`
       (worker pattern) if the intent is to roll forward live writes.

    Args:
        state_dir: Directory the snapshot hook operates on — typically
            ``$STATE_LOCATION``. Harvest scans it (step 1) and prune
            cleans it (step 4).
        canonical: Path the host's filesystem capture will grab —
            typically ``state_dir / "workspace.db"``. The runtime path
            is derived from this via
            :func:`runtime_paths_for(canonical).runtime`.
        config: Snapshot config used by step 4 to identify which files
            in ``state_dir`` the importer would have consumed.
            ``None`` skips pruning entirely (correct for apps with no
            CSV/JSON sources, e.g. pure DB-uploaded state).
        import_hook: Step 2 callable. Returns an ``int`` exit code; a
            non-zero return raises :class:`RuntimeError` and aborts the
            rest of the orchestration. ``None`` skips step 2.
        build_index_hook: Step 3 callable. Returns nothing; raises on
            failure. ``None`` skips step 3.
        post_harvest_hook: Optional step-1b callable that fires
            **between** harvest (step 1) and import (step 2). Receives
            the ``list[(src, dst)]`` tuples harvest produced; can rename
            or relocate harvested files so the import / index / snapshot
            consumers find them at app-specific paths. The canonical use
            case is sidecar DBs that don't fit the standard hashed-runtime
            layout — e.g. Foundry-Google-Workspace's docvec sidecar lands
            at ``db.vec.vec_db_path(canonical)`` not at the harvest-
            computed hashed runtime path. Exceptions propagate; hooks
            should be idempotent. ``None`` (default) skips the hook.
        drop_tables: Forwarded to :func:`snapshot_db_via_runtime` —
            additional regular tables to drop on the snapshot copy
            (e.g. ``["docvec_documents", "docvec_chunks"]``).
        drop_virtual_tables: Forwarded to :func:`snapshot_db_via_runtime`
            — default ``True`` drops every CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE on the
            snapshot copy.
        runtime: Optional override for the live runtime path. Forwarded
            to :func:`snapshot_db_via_runtime`. Also used as the
            ``protect_paths`` argument to :func:`harvest_db_files`, so
            a direct-mode binding (``runtime == canonical`` under
            ``state_dir``) doesn't have its live DB moved out from
            under the engine at step 1. ``None`` (default) preserves
            the historical runtime-mode behaviour: hashed ``/tmp``
            runtime path, harvest moves everything.

    Returns:
        :class:`SnapshotHookResult` with per-step observability data
        (what got harvested, what got pruned, whether the index was
        rebuilt, the final canonical path).

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: When ``import_hook`` returns a non-zero exit
            code. The DB is in an unknown state at that point;
            steps 3-5 don't run.
        FileNotFoundError: From step 5 — see
            :func:`snapshot_db_via_runtime` for the conditions.
        Anything ``build_index_hook`` raises (propagated unchanged so
            FTS rebuild failures are loud, not swallowed).

    # we let harvest_db_files run unconditionally it would see that
    # clean .db, move it onto the hashed /tmp runtime path, and
    # shutil.move overwrites — clobbering the live indexed runtime
    # (which has the agent task's writes + rebuilt FTS5 / vec0 indexes).
    #
    # Detect "the runtime is the source of truth" by asking: does a
    # runtime already exist at the hashed path for this canonical? If
    # yes, the canonical in state_dir (if present and directly under
    # state_dir so harvest would see it) is a stale snapshot artifact;
    # delete it WITH its sidecars before harvest runs.
    #
    # We only remove the file harvest would have picked up — the
    # canonical .db at state_dir/<name>.db. Any *other* .db files
    # someone dropped into state_dir (test fixtures, sidecar DBs)
    # still get harvested normally; this guard is specifically about
    # not feeding the previous-call's own output back onto its runtime.
    #
    # Marker-fingerprint discriminator (added to fix the bind_engine
    # composition bug reported by Foundry-zoho): the original guard
    # assumed the only way a runtime exists at facade-entry is that a
    # *prior* snapshot_with_populate cold-seeded it AND something wrote
    # to it since. ``bind_engine``'s cold-seed-on-call broke that
    # assumption — the runtime can exist at entry as a byte-for-byte
    # copy of state_dir/<canonical>, with zero divergence. Deleting
    # state_dir/<canonical> in that case strips the SME-shipped pre-built
    # DB that step 1's harvest needs to detect for PR #136's auto-skip,
    # which then re-runs the importer on top of pre-built rows and PK-
    # collides.
    #
    # The fix: compare the runtime's ``.srcmeta`` marker fingerprint
    # against state_dir/<canonical>'s current fingerprint. cold_seed_runtime
    # writes the marker with the source canonical's fingerprint, so the
    # marker has three possible states with three different meanings:
    #
    #   - MATCH (marker == canonical fp)
    #              → runtime is a faithful copy of state_dir/<canonical>;
    #              harvest moving state_dir/<canonical> onto the runtime
    #              path is a no-op for the underlying bytes (same data),
    #              and PR #136's auto-skip will correctly fire on the
    #              harvest result. Skip step 0's deletion.
    #   - MISMATCH (marker present, fp differs)
    #              → runtime has diverged from state_dir/<canonical>
    #              (post-snapshot clean canonical, new SME deploy, live
    #              writes after a marker stamp). state_dir is stale →
    #              delete (preserves runtime's divergence).
    #   - MISSING (marker file absent OR empty)
    #              → runtime origin is unknown. Could be (a) an empty
    #              runtime lazy-created by SQLAlchemy when ``bind_engine``
    #              cold-seeded before the SME canonical was downloaded
    #              (the Modal boot race that caused the Atlassian /
    #              FGW empty-DB-in-Studio symptom), or (b) a faithful
    #              copy whose marker got lost. The safe default in
    #              EITHER case is: prefer canonical. Harvest will move
    #              canonical onto the runtime path, replacing whatever
    #              was there; PR #136's auto-skip then fires.
    #
    # Why prefer canonical when marker is missing rather than delete it:
    # canonical lives on persistent storage (Modal volume), runtime on
    # tmpfs. If the marker is absent, we can't tell whether runtime has
    # authoritative writes — but tmpfs is volatile and the marker is
    # the contract that says "this runtime was authoritatively stamped".

    """Delete every file in ``state_dir`` that the importer just consumed.

    **Call this immediately after populate**, not at snapshot time. The
    importer has just written its content into the DB; the source files
    are now redundant. Pruning here means:

    * The next snapshot ships only the ``.db`` (via
      :func:`snapshot_db_only`) plus whatever the agent actually
      *creates* during the task — no leftover source CSVs.
    * Agent-created files matching an entity's import shape are
      **preserved**. They appear in ``state_dir`` AFTER this function
      runs, so the next snapshot ships them. Pruning at snapshot time
      instead would delete those agent artefacts, silently losing
      task output.

    Coverage (every file :func:`discover_snapshot` would route to an
    entity, regardless of format):

    * Files matched by an entity's ``files:`` glob — including CSVs,
      JSONs, and binary documents (PDFs, DOCX, …) registered via the
      ``mcp_files`` reader.
    * Files matched by header-signature detection
      (:func:`detect_entity_type`).
    * Multi-entity reader files (one file carrying many tables).

    Files in the ``_unrecognized`` bucket — i.e. nothing in
    ``config.entities`` claims them — are **left alone**. Sidecar files
    the snapshot itself produces (``workspace.db``, ``workspace.db.srcmeta``,
    ``database_dump.sql``, manifests, …) are not declared as import
    sources so they survive.

    Args:
        state_dir: Directory the snapshot was written to.
        config: Same :class:`SnapshotConfig` the next populate will use.
            Matching is driven by ``config.entities[*].files`` and
            ``config.sources``; mismatched configs will under- or
            over-prune accordingly.

    Returns:
        Sorted list of absolute :class:`Path` objects for the files that
        were deleted. Useful for log lines and post-snapshot assertions.

    Best-effort delete: a per-file failure (locked / vanished /
    permission denied) is logged and skipped rather than aborting — a
    partially-pruned snapshot is strictly better than a broken one, and
    the caller can re-run the function (it's idempotent — deleting an
    already-deleted file is a no-op).
