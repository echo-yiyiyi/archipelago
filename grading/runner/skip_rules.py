"""
Shared rules for skipping verifiers that cannot be graded without a trajectory.

A trajectory with no transcript (e.g. an ``external_artifact`` upload that only
carries output files) has an empty ``trajectory.output``/``trajectory.messages``.
Two classes of verifiers are ungradeable in that situation:

1. Verifiers whose eval depends on a *trajectory-dependent helper* — these
   helpers parse the transcript / live agent state and produce nothing useful
   on an empty trajectory.
2. Verifiers whose eval grades *only* the transcript/output and reads no
   filesystem signal (``TRANSCRIPT_ONLY_EVALS``) — there is nothing to grade,
   and several of these eval impls RAISE on missing output keys.

File/artifact verifiers (which read the final snapshot filesystem) are NOT
skipped and still run + get scored.

This module is the single source of truth for both:
- ``validate.py`` (golden-end-state validation, no trajectory), and
- ``main.py``'s full scoring path when ``skip_trajectory_verifiers=True``.
