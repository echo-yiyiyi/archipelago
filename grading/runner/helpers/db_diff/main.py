    - If diff_all_types=False (default): Priority-based fallback
      1. First tries to find SQLite .db files
      2. If none found, tries to find MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL SQL dump files
      3. If neither found, tries to find JSON data files
      4. If nothing found, returns empty result

    - If diff_all_types=True: Diffs ALL data sources in parallel
      1. Finds and diffs SQLite .db files
      2. Finds and diffs SQL dump files
      3. Finds and diffs JSON data files
      4. Merges all results into a single response

    Compares all databases found and produces a structured diff showing
    rows added, deleted, and modified per table.

    Args:
        initial_snapshot_bytes: Task snapshot (initial state after populate hook)
        final_snapshot_bytes: Trajectory snapshot (final state after agent)
        trajectory: Agent trajectory output (for metadata)
        json_id_field: Optional field name to use as row identity when diffing
            JSON arrays (e.g. 'course_name'). When None, auto-detects via
            heuristic scan of common id field names.
        diff_all_types: If True, diffs all data source types (SQLite, SQL dumps,
            JSON) in parallel. If False, uses priority-based fallback (default).

    Returns:
