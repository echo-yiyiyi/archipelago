"""Streaming SQLite loader for SQL dumps, CSV files, and raw .db extraction.

Streams a SQL dump directly from a snapshot zip into an on-disk SQLite file
using the chunked parser from ``parsers.sql``.  Never loads the full dump
into memory.  Also supports loading CSV files (one table per file, table
name derived from the filename stem).

When the snapshot contains a raw ``.db`` file (e.g. ``workspace.db``),
:func:`extract_db_from_snapshot` can extract it directly — skipping the
expensive SQL-dump-to-SQLite round-trip entirely.

Schema is inferred from the first row per table (all columns use SQLite's
TEXT affinity; dynamic typing handles numeric comparisons transparently).
No sqlglot transpilation is needed — INSERT data is dialect-agnostic for
basic value types, and CREATE TABLE is auto-generated from column names.
